                  Graphic design is the creative process of combining text, images, shapes, and colors to convey ideas in a clear and visually appealing manner. One of the strongest assets a business can have is its impact on branding, marketing, and digital presence. From logos and brochures to social media posts and websites, design plays a big role in how people see and remember a brand.
